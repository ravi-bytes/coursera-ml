Solutions to Coursera ML

NOTE - the author does not encourage any plagiarism by users of this code.
The intent of sharing this code is for users who have difficulty with the tests to attempt it on their own.
My solutions are commented in a highly verbose manner to explain the intent of every step involved so that users can later fully understand why they are doing what they are doing instead of going through the motions mechanically.

Please stick to the Coursera Honor Code:
